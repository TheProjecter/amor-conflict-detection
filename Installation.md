# Installation #

Please note that so far only Eclipse Helios (version 3.6) is supported. We are currently working on upgrading AMOR for Eclipse Indigo (version 3.7). Thus, download the [Eclipse Modeling Tools Helios](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools-includes-incubating-components/heliossr2) from the Eclipse download page. Next, install the AMOR conflict detection component by using our update site, which is available at http://www.modelversioning.org/updatesite

If you are unfamiliar with installing eclipse plug-ins from update sites, please consult the [help pages of Eclipse](http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-32.htm).
